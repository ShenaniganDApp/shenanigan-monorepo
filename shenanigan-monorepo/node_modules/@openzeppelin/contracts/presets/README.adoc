These contracts integrate different Ethereum standards (ERCs) with custom extensions and modules, showcasing common configurations that are ready to deploy **without having to write any Solidity code**.

They can be used as-is for quick prototyping and testing, but are **also suitable for production environments**.

TIP: Intermediate and advanced users can use these as starting points when writing their own contracts, extending them with custom functionality as they see fit.

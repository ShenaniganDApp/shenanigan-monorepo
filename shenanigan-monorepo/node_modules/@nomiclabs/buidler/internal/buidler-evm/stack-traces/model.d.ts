     * We compute selectors manually, which is particularly hard. We do this

     * from the AST node. This is surprisingly super hard: things like inherited
     * enums, structs and ABIv2 complicate it.
     *
     * As we know that that can fail, we run a heuristic that tries to correct
     * incorrect selectors. What it does is checking the `evm.methodIdentifiers`
     * compiler output, and detect missing selectors. Then we take those and
     * find contract functions with the same name. If there are multiple of those
     * we can't do anything. If there is a single one, it must have an incorrect
     * selector, so we update it with the `evm.methodIdentifiers`'s value.

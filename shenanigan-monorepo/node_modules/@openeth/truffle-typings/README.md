# truffle-typings

Truffle typings for migrations, tests etc. If you want to have fully typed contracts you need to use [Typechain](https://github.com/krzkaczor/TypeChain) (target=truffle) project to generate typings based on ABIs. It doesn't force any new API.

## Install

```
yarn add --dev truffle-typings
```

or

```
npm install --save-dev truffle-typings
```

<!-- SCRUM uses user stories as the building blocks to create large complicated systems. A user story can be constructed in 3 parts (As, I want, and So that). Acceptance criteria outline the concrete technical requirements to make the changes outlined by the user story. Acceptance criteria outline the concrete technical requirements to make the changes outlined by the user story. -->

# User Story
<!-- A user story looks at the problem from the user's perspective. Define the user, define the feature, and define the feature. If the problem does not fit the scope of a specific user (common in backend work) please explain why in the section below  -->

<!-- Example:
> *As a* website user
> *I want* to able to submit feedback
> *So that* the website owners can consider my opinion or concern during future website updates
-->

## As a ...


## I want ...


## So that ...




## Comments and Outliers 


# Acceptance Criteria
<!-- Acceptance Criteria outline the technical requirements. Ask yourself, "What needs to exist in my environment to accomplish the user story. If you find the acceptance criteria getting large, It may be beneficial to split up the issue into multiple smaller issues. -->

<!--Example:

 Given I’m in a role of logged-in or guest user
> When I open the Feedback page
> Then the system shows me the Submit Feedback form containing “Email”,“Name” and “Comment” fields which are required
> When I fill in the “Email” field with a valid email address
> And I fill in the “Name” field with my name
> And I fill in the “Comment” field with my comment
> And I click the “Submit Feedback” button
> Then the system submits my feedback
> And the system shows the “You’ve successfully submitted your feedback” flash message
> And the system clears the fields of the Submit Feedback form” -->
